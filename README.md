**Abstract**

The present study examined how children spontaneously represent facial cues associated with emotion. 106 three- to six-year-old children (48 male, 58 female; 9.4% Asian, 84.0% White, 6.6% more than one race) and 40 adults (10 male, 30 female; 10% Hispanic, 30% Asian, 2.5% Black, 57.5% White) were recruited from a Midwestern city (2019 to 2020), and sorted emotion cues in a spatial arrangement method that assesses emotion knowledge without reliance on emotion vocabulary. Using supervised and unsupervised analyses, the study found evidence for continuities and gradual changes in children’s emotion knowledge compared to adults. Emotion knowledge develops through an incremental learning process in which children change their representations using combinations of factors—particularly valence—that are weighted differently across development.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

- **analysis**: analysis scripts in R
- **data**: data associated with the manuscript
- **experiment**: experiment scripts and stimuli
- **manuscript**: manuscript files for the final paper

The analyses reported in the manuscript are organized in the folder **analysis/paper_2020**. This folder contains:
- **GRD_main.Rmd**: the main analysis script summarizing all analyses reported in the paper.
- **GRD_supplementary.Rmd**: supplementary analyses conducted for the manuscript.
- **pipeline_scripts** folder has a set of numbered R scripts breaking down individual processing and analysis steps conducted. Numbers are in the order in which to run each script (e.g., 1_processing.R).
