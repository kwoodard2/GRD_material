# Grid-Task
Stimuli, data, and analysis scripts for a study using the spatial arrangement method to investigate changes in children's emotion knowledge across development.

Anonymous Authors (in prep). The Representation of Emotion Knowledge Across Development.

**Abstract**

The present task sought to better understand how children spontaneously represent and prioritize information about facial cues of emotion. Children sorted facial cues of emotion based on judgments of similarity in a variation of the spatial arrangement method. The task and analyses circumvented common limitations in the study of children’s emotion knowledge by not requiring emotion vocabulary terms and by conducting both top-down, supervised and bottom-up, unsupervised analyses. We found children’s organization of emotion knowledge gradually became more aligned with adults across development and relied on valence (both bipolar and bivariate), arousal, and emotion category to guide their similarity judgments. Furthermore, children initially used broader valence-based distinctions to guide their emotion judgments that became more discrete through an increase and refinement in the use of valence and emotion categories. The central role of valence in participants’ similarity judgements across ages, even among adults, suggests that valence forms the basis for how people structure perceptual information about emotions.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following folders:

- **analysis**: analysis scripts in R
- **data**: data associated with the manuscript
- **experiment**: experiment scripts and stimuli
- **manuscript**: manuscript files for the final paper

The analyses reported in the manuscript are organized in the folder **analysis/paper_2020**. This folder contains:
- **GRD_main.Rmd**: the main analysis script summarizing all analyses reported in the paper.
- **GRD_supplementary.Rmd**: supplementary analyses conducted for the manuscript.
- **pipeline_scripts** folder has a set of numbered R scripts breaking down individual processing and analysis steps conducted. Numbers are in the order in which to run each script (e.g., 1_processing.R).
